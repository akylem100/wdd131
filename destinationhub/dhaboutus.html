        <h2>How was Destination Hub founded?</h2>
        <p class="p-about">Founded in 2024, Destination Hub started as an idea for Kyle Amerjan, a man who was passionate about traveling around
            the United States. As motivation to travel grew, Kyle began researching destinations in various states. He created a plan
            for himself, but then thought, 'What if we could help others achieve the same?' He already organized various travel ideas and enjoyed saving
            pictures of what he would be traveling to. For this reason, he decided to create Destination Hub. Today, it continues to grow as a means
            of becoming one of the greatest organized sources to discover destinations all around the United States. </p>
