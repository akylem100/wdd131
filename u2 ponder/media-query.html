            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things 
                which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no bcommandments unto the children of men, 
                save he shall cprepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.

            <p>
                Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; 
                and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, 
                and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be 
                perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.
